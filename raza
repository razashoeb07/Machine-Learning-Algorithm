Problem Statement: Given above data build a machine learning model that can predict home prices based on square feet area
You can represent values in above table as a scatter plot (values are shown in red markers). After that one can draw a straight line that best fits values on chart.

You might remember about linear equation from your high school days math class. Home prices can be presented as following equation,

home price = m * (area) + b

Generic form of same equation is,
